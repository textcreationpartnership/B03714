         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HUMBLE ADDRESS OF THE GRAND JURY Of the BOROUGH of TAMWORTH;</head>
            <p>Preſented to the Bayliffs, High Steward, Recorder, and the reſt of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, at the General Quarter-Seſsions of the Peace for the ſaid Borough, holden the Twenty Seventh day of <hi>April,</hi> 1682. And by the unanimous Conſent of the Court agreed upon and ordered to be under the Common Seal of this Town, PRESENTED To the Kings moſt Excellent MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>WE Your Majeſties moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, having already preſumed to preſent Your Majeſty with our hearty thanks for, and acknowledgment of Your great Goodneſs to us and other Your Loyal Subjects, expreſſed in Your late Gracious Declaration of Your Princely Reſolutions for the future Government of this Your Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> And finding that ſome reſtleſs Spirits, ungrateful both to God and Your Majeſty for the Bleſsings they enjoy under Your peaceable Reign, had thoughts of entring into an illegal and abominable <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> a Draught whereof found amongſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Papers Your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to publiſh to the World: We think our ſelves obliged both in Duty and Conſcience to teſtifie both to Your Majeſty and the Nation our utter diſlike and abhorrence of the ſame. <hi>Neither are we of opinion that any the moſt <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led pretenſions to Zeal and Duty ſet forth in the Preamble are specious enough to ſanctifie the unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable and dangerous Concluſion.</hi> Some of us are old enough to remember in Your Bleſſed Fathers Reign what undutiful Propoſitions and Demands were uſhered in with profeſsions of Zeal for Religion and Care of his Royal Perſon. The end whereof was the making him indeed a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King in Heaven, but a Miſerable one on Earth. And we hope, Sir, that this Nation will be too wiſe to be drawn twice through the ſame water by the very ſame <hi>Cat.</hi> In ſhort, Great Sir, we from our hearts diſown any Thoughts, but thoſe of Obedience to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, which is the Principle the true Proteſtant Religion teacheth, and whoſoever Preach or practiſe any contrary Doctrine, may ſtile themſelves Sober Proteſtants, but can never prove themſelves to be either true Chriſtians or good Subjects. God preſerve Your Majeſty in health and peace, continue the Crown in its Legal Deſcent, defend You from the Loyalty of ſuch as would diveſt You of Your Authority for the Security of Your Perſon. And may You at length be allowed the benefit of thoſe Laws which You are ſo Graciouſly pleaſed to give the full advantage of to Your People.</p>
